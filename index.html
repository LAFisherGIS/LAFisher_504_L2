	<h2>Library-to-Hospital Planning Tool</h2>
	<p>This map allows for the quick and easy discovery of the hospital nearest to a given library in Tacoma, Washington. Whether you work there or simply go there regularly, just tap or click a library (the open book icons) to find the nearest hospital's name, its address, and the distance to your library, and have that hospital surrounded by a blue circle. Note however that this may not actually be the most efficient hospital to visit, as distances are provided in an as-the-crow-flies manner and the creator is not aware of any crows which read in libraries and use maps to navigate.</p>
